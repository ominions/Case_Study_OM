      \section{Forms of Ownership}
      In the company, the CEO of the company is also the owner, making it a sole proprietorship. This business structure, where there is no legal distinction between the owner and the business entity, allows for complete control over all business decisions but also entails the risk of unlimited personal liability for the owner. Despite being a sole proprietorship, the company can still engage in partnerships with other businesses, including sister companies. Sister companies are separate legal entities that share common ownership or control, typically through a parent company. These partnerships can take various forms, such as strategic alliances, joint ventures, or contractual agreements, where each entity maintains its own separate legal and operational structure. In such a partnership, the sole proprietorship might collaborate with sister companies for various purposes, such as resource sharing, market expansion, cost reduction, or innovation. Each entity in the partnership retains its own legal identity, but they work together to leverage their combined strengths. The exact nature of these partnerships would depend on the agreements made between the companies and the strategic objectives they aim to achieve.
